Creative Features:

1. Used Bootstrap to improve aesthetic experience of using the site. Also allows good adaptability to different window widths

2. Embedded scroll views for each chatroom

3. Used a tab bar to represent all chatrooms that the user is currently member of

4. Implemented a "un-ban" feature: the owner of the room can unban a banned user by clicking on the corresponding button under "Ban List"; the originally banned user would then receive an alert notifying of the action, and can rejoin the room.
